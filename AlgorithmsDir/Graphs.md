# Graphs
In maths we can say that a graph is a group of vertex and edges "G = (V, E)"

Example of a graph with V = 3 and E = 5:

## Types of Graphs depending on its direction

### **Directed:**
The Edges only travels in one direction

Ex: We can see that A is connected with C but C is not connected to A

### **Undirected or Bidirectional:**
The Edges can travel in both directions

Ex: We can see that A is connected with C and C is connected with A

Also it can be represented without the arrows
